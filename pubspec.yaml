  # F.T.S. we need this in direct deps cause we need to launch createSplash()
  # another solution remove this from deps and force user to run `flutter pub run flutter_native_splash:create` manualy
  # third way is to launch `process.start` from the_splash script byt user can use fvm or other tools
  # all ways looks bad :[
